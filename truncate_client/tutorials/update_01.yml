        - message: |-
            Sorry to interrupt your game, but there has been a small rule change you should know about.

        - message: |-
            Originally, all attacking words had to be valid for an attack to succeed.
            
            From now on, only the strongest attacker matters, and an attack can succeed even if some attackers are invalid.
        - message: |-
            Now it should be easier for you to calculate whether an attack succeeds:
            
            If the strongest attacker beats the weakest defender (plus defender's advantage), the attack succeeds.

        - description: |-
            Try playing "ENOUGH" and "EEX" against "FOUR".

            Originally this failed, now it will succeed.
            
          you: "E -> 6,5"
          gets: "I"
        - message: |-
            Since "ENOUGH" was long enough to beat "FOUR" it wins the battle, and "EEX" is irrelevant despite being invalid and too short.
