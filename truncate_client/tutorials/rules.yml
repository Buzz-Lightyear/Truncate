            Welcome to Truncate!

            This tutorial covers the rules of the game.

          message: |-
            In Truncate, players take turns to place a tile on the board

          message: |-
            In this game you are playing as blue. You will generally play as blue unless you're facing a human opponent.

            You can tell which colour you're playing by the colour of the tiles in your hand.

          description: |-
            You start the game by placing tiles beside your dock.

            Your dock is at the bottom left of the board. Try playing an 'L' there.
          you: "L -> 1,1"
          gets: "E"

            Now it's your opponent's turn.

            Click Next to see their first move.
          computer: "D -> 4,7"
          gets: "R"

        - description: |-
            Once you've placed a tile, you can place tiles beside your dock or your existing tiles.

            Try playing an 'I' beside the 'L' you just played.
          you: "L -> 1,2"
          gets: "E"

            To win Truncate, you must touch your opponent's town with a valid word.

            Notice that your dock is on the right hand side on this boad, and your opponent's town and dock are on the left.

            To win, the word touching your opponent's town has to be valid, but the rest of your words don't.

            You will win if you play 'R' to form 'YOUR', even though you have invalid words like 'AXQT' on your board.

            Instead of playing a tile from your hand, you can swap two tiles on the board.

            Try turning "VALDI" into "VALID" by swapping the "D" and "I." Note, you can't swap between the board and your hand.

            The only words involved in the battle are those that are actually touching an opponent's words.

            This means our board can consist of largely invalid words, yet we can still win battles.

            Try playing "TO" against the opponent's "TF".
            
            Even though your board is mostly invalid, the only words involved in the battle are "TO" and "TF", so you'll win.
